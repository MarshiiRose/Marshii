-ok so I never actually finished the big update which I thought I did... OOPS! (all 6's) anyways I won't be able to work on the mod for like 9 months bc of irl stuff so see yall back in the summer !!!

I don't think this mod requires any additional mods to work properly other than like the bare minimum as of now
In the future I might use other mods to get those huge numbers and exponentiation and all that cool stuff
